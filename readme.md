## Five summers across Fram Strait, Arctic Ocean: regional and vertical patterns in microbial communities and substrate regimes 

Bioinformatic code for bacterial community analyses in "Five summers across Fram Strait, Arctic Ocean: regional and vertical patterns in microbial communities and substrate regimes" by Wietz and colleagues (doi: XXX). Metabarcoding reads were obtained using 16S rRNA primers, followed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing and generation of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using DADA2 following https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html. The repo includes the full pipeline (raw fastq reads to ASV taxonomy) and all subsequent analyses.
