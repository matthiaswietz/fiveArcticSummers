## The Arctic summer microbiome (2015-2019) across Fram Strait: depth, region and substrates structure microbial diversity in the euphotic zone 

Bioinformatic code for bacterial community analyses in doi: XXX by Wietz and colleagues. The study employed metabarcoding of 16S rRNA genes via Illumina MiSeq sequencing, and generation of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html). The repo includes the full pipeline (raw fastq reads to ASV taxonomy) and all subsequent analyses in context of environmental data.
