## The Arctic summer microbiome across Fram Strait: depth, region and substrates structure microbial diversity in the euphotic zone 

Bioinformatic code for bacterial community analyses in "The Arctic summer microbiome across Fram Strait: depth, region and substrates structure microbial diversity in the euphotic zone" by Wietz and colleagues (doi: XXX). Metabarcoding reads were obtained using 16S rRNA primers, followed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing and generation of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html). The repo includes the full pipeline (raw fastq reads to ASV taxonomy) and all subsequent analyses in context of environmental data.
